# Dataset
* Description: This dataset included a part of 3Ã— test sets, which were obtained from TanDEM-X and Sentienl-2. The dataset contains a total of 100 256*256 data pairs. Each data pair contains one complete DEM, one Mask and one RS image. Complete DEM, remote sensing images can be obtained from https://www.intelligence-airbusds.com and https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, respectively.
